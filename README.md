Ensuring your .py file has all four of the CRUD components, and then succcessfully calling it from you .ipynb file helps to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Also, less is more!
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you 
approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare
requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments 
in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to 
create databases to meet other client requests?
It was helpful that we were given so many resources to draw from in the creation of this project. I spent a lot of time debugging typos and missing commas or brackets, or putting a period instead of a comma, but I was finally able to test the code chunk by chunk since it contained so many components. 
My work on this type of project for a company like Grazioso Salvare would help them to be able to have a database that they can update, search, and determine the status and location of animals. Without computer scientists, these programs couldn't exist.
